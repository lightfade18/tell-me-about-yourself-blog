		Childhood is one of the best part of our lives, as <em>we think only happiness and enjoynment</em>.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;
		Yes, as I remember, my childhood years was full of <b>happiness and joy</b>.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;
		It was the time that all I think and do is to play until I get sleepy.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;
		As I grow up in our father's province, I have so many cousins at my age to play.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;
		In that time, <dfn>mobile phones are not that used, so what we play are traditional games like 
		<mark>tumbang lata</mark>, <mark style="background-color:orange">jolen</mark>, <mark style="background-color:lightred">sticker</mark>, 
		<mark style="background-color:lightgreen">goma</mark> and <mark style="background-color:skyblue">etc</mark></dfn>.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;
		I think those were <strong>one of the best moments my life</strong>.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;
		Then I also remember my kinder and elementary days.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;
		I remember that in my <u>1st grade</u> in elementary, I transferred 3 times from Manila to Pangasinan, then to Mindanao.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;
		<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/childhood5.png" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/childhood5.png" alt="Me wearing a red shirt and a blue baggy pants standing in a stage with a ribbon in my neck." class="right"></a>
		I think the language was the hardest part on those times, as it was hard to adapt.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;
		In my childhood also where I remember that I always got an earful from my parents, especially my father.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;
		Because he is an <b>athlete</b>, <b>discipline</b> is one of the most important in our family.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;
		<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/childhood3.png" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/childhood3.png" alt="A picture that is in a wooden frame, where the child is wering ablue shirt and shorts." class="left"></a>
		I remember that I always have to wake up early in the morning to do house chores, like get water from the water pump in our local area, and <dfn>I hated it so much</dfn>.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;
		I also remember how I get discipline from my father, <dfn>he doesn't usually get physical, but when he does then pain will come</dfn>.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;
		<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/childhood6.png" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/childhood6.png" alt="A picture of a child with a cake beside the child." class="right"></a>
		In my mother side, I remember she doesn't discipline me physically but verbally, especially when I got home full of dirt because of playing.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;
		But what I will not forget is her <b>pinch in my ears</b>, <dfn>and that is one of the most painful experience that I've had</dfn>.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;
		<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/childhood4.jpeg" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/childhood4.jpeg" alt="A boy wearing a witch outfit." class="left"></a>
		I also has a <b>younger sister</b> to take care of, I remember that <dfn>I'm the one in charge of watching her when she's sleeping and my mother is doing her household chores</dfn>.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;
		I also remember my childhood friends, especially my classmate name <em>Jhon Lee</em> as my parents almost think that we are like real brothers because of how close we are as a friend.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;
		Overall, I think my chidlhood years are those years that I dont think about <b>consequences</b>, free from <b>judgements</b> and <b>expectations</b> from others.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;
		<strong>My childhood is those times that gave me memories that I will cherish forever in my life.</strong><sup>19</sup>&nbsp;
		But I remember that in the later part of my childhood years is where <dfn>my parents starts to drift apart from each other</dfn>.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;
		And that part <b>will affect me greatly as my years continues</b>.<sup>21</sup>

			Teenage years as they say is <em><q>a crucial stage in human life that needs utmost parental care, guidance, and empathy.</q></em><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;
			It is those years that <em>defines the character</em> of an individual.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;
			But my teenage years are rough for me, as it was the start of hardships.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;
			My family was <b>broken</b>, we <b>sturggle financially</b> and more.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;
			It was those times that leads me to <b>wrong paths</b>, <dfn>like drinking, smoking and etc</dfn>.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;
			And it affect me so much in terms of decision making, education and how I treat others.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;
			<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/teenage2.png" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/teenage2.png" alt="A groupie of people with a lechon included." class="cright"></a>
			Because there is almost no one to guide me, as my father start to work far away, and my mother and sister left us.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;
			But despite everything that happened, there is <b>one person</b> that help me to get back at the right path and that is my <strong>Aunt</strong>.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;
			<dfn>She stop me from my bad habits, scolded me if I'm doing wrong and many more</dfn>.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;
			And most importantly, she gave me shelter <mark><em>physically and emotionally</em></mark>.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;
			Yes, I owe her a lot, without her I think I'm not in my position right now as a student.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;
			Without her, I think I'm not where I am supposed to be right now..<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;
			<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/teenage3.jpg" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/teenage3.jpg" alt="A selfie of a teenager." class="left"></a>
			As I live with my Aunt, the first thing that I learned from her is to give <b>respect</b> back to others.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;
			She also encourage me to <dfn>pursue education back again</dfn>.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;
			And because of that, <u>I get back to school because I stop for 2 years in high school</u>.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;
			Yes, I admit that after I get back to school again, my bad habits didn't easily go away.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;
			I always skip classes, always go out on night with my school friends and etc.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;
			But despite that, I manage to graduate my highschool years.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;
			After I graduated my highschool, my father told me to go to Manila where he works, and I accepted.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;
			And as I go to Manila, then also <dfn>my College life starts</dfn>.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;

			<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/college4.jpeg" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/college4.jpeg" alt="A picture of student in Enchanted Kingdom." class="cleft"></a>
			My College Years, is where I start to learn <b>reality</b>.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;
			Expectations, pressures, financial problems and many more starts to crumble me again.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;
			My first hard decision coming to college is I think picking my course.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;
			Because I'm not a good student in my highschool days, I didn't think about my future profession tha hard.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;
			But what led me choosing <var><b>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</b></var>&nbsp;(<abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Information Technology">BSIT</abbr>) is I think because I love interacting with computers so much, especially computer games.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;
			But the funny part is that BSIT doesn't have that much relation in the gaming part.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;
			<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/college3.jpeg" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/college3.jpeg" alt="A picture that shows a group of students taking selfie." class="cright"></a>
			As a lower class family, education is not easy, especially in a University.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;
			But I choose to study at the <var><b>University of the East</b></var>&nbsp;(<abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr>) because my only cousin that is in Manila is studying in <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr>.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;
			At my first day in college, I struggle to adjust with my environment because <dfn>I came from a province, no friend to talk to at first and also I am socially awkward to others</dfn>.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;
			But after a few more days, I start to interact with my new classmates and acquire some friends.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;
			Then after conquering my social awkwardness then comes programming, because I didn't experience the <em>new curriculum that is <b>Senior Highschool</b></em>, I have basically no knowledge about programming.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;
			<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/college2.png" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/college2.png" alt="A picture of student in a cafeteria." class="cleft"></a>
			When our professor show me this code - <code><b>print"Hello World!"</b></code>, all of my classmates knew it except me that has no idea and its funny to think about it right now.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;
			My 1st year 1st semester was a mess, <dfn>I barely passed my subject</dfn> and realize the <b>gap</b> between me and my course.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;
			Then comes 2nd semester, because of the pressure of being just barely passed in my previous semester and our financial capabilities starts to get rough.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;
			<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/college1.png" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/college1.png" alt="A picture that shows a group of students taking selfie." class="cright"></a>
			<dfn>I study so hard that I almost get sick of the voices of arabs that teaches programming</dfn> in <cite><b>Youtube</b></cite>.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;
			And because of that, after our 2nd semester <dfn>I manage to get <b>University Scholarship</b></dfn>&nbsp;(<abbr title="University Scholarship">US</abbr>) in my university by getting a <b>General Weighted Average</b>&nbsp;(<abbr title="General Weighted Average">GWA</abbr>) of <samp><b>1.34</b></samp>.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;
			After I got the scholarship, my father is so happy and I'm also happy about it, as it ease our financial situation on that time.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;
			<a href="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/ppic.jpg" target="_winImage"><img src="RODRIGUEZ_pictures/ppic.jpg" alt="A selfie picture with a christmas tree in the background." class="left"></a>
			Then start my 2nd year 1st semester, coming to that semester comes expectation that I will again achieve scholarship, <dfn>but it hits me back so hard</dfn>.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;
			Because of the expectation, I got pressured, and at our finals week on that semester, <dfn>I got sick and hospitalized for almost 2 weeks and cannot attend my classes on those days</dfn>.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;
			It affect my exams because I feel sick even after I got discharged, then because of that my grades drop, and eventually <dfn>didn't get the scholarship again</dfn>.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp; 
			Because of that I stopped for <b>1 year</b>, and after that, right now, I got back to school again <em><mark>strong and full of determination</mark></em>, and hope that I can do my <b>best</b>, so that I can get great results after this semester.<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;
