			<h2>Film/Movie</h2>
			<p>
				A film, also called a movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a work of 
				visual art used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, 
				perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images.
				These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other 
				sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often
				used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that 
				is the result of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a
				motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using 
				traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or 
				by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.
			</p>

			<h2>TV Shows</h2>
			<p>
				A television show or simply TV show is any content produced for viewing on a 
				television set which can be broadcast via over-the-air, satellite, 
				cable, excluding breaking news, advertisements, or trailers that are typically
				placed between shows. Television shows are most often scheduled for broadcast
				well ahead of time and appear on electronic guides or other TV listings, but 
				streaming services often make them available for viewing anytime. The content
				in a television show can be produced with different methodologies such as 
				taped variety shows emanating from a television studio stage, animation or a 
				variety of film productions ranging from movies to series. Shows not produced
				on a television studio stage are usually contracted or licensed to be made by
				appropriate production companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Television shows can be viewed: live (real time); be recorded on home video;
				a digital video recorder for later viewing; be viewed on demand via a 
				set-top box or streamed over the internet.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money Heist (Spanish: La casa de papel, "The House

						the Bank of Spain. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion 
						and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, 
						and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the 
						heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman, Tokyo 
						(Úrsula Corberó), and having a strong Spanish identity, where 
						emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.
