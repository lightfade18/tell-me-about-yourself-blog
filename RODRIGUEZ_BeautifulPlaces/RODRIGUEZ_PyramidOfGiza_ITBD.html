					<p>
						The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the 
						Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the Giza 
						pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is 
						the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to 
						remain largely intact.
					</p>
					<p>
						Egyptologists conclude that the pyramid was built as a tomb for the 
						Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and estimate that it took up to 
						26 years to build, being completed circa 2560 BC.
					</p>
					<p>
						Initially standing at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the 
						tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. The 
						base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a 
						volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), which 
						includes an internal hillock.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was originally covered by white limestone casing stones that formed a 
						smooth outer surface; The pyramid was dismantled and used as a quarry, 
						mostly in the middle ages, which lowered its height to the present 137 
						metres (449.5 ft). What is seen today is the underlying core structure, 
						although a few casing stones are still In situ.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large 
						stones weighing 6 million tonnes total, which were dragged into position. 
						Many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses attempt to explain the 
						exact construction techniques. Primarily local limestone from the Giza 
						Plateau was used. Other blocks were imported by boat down the Nile: White 
						limestone from Tura for the casing, and granite blocks from Aswan, 
						weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the King's Chamber structure.
					</p>
					<p>
						The dimensions of the pyramid, expressed in ancient Egyptian units of 
						measurement, are 280 cubits high, a base length of 440 cubits, with a 
						Seked of 5:1/2 palms (a slope of 51°50'40").
					</p>
					<p>
						There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest 
						chamber was cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built but 
						remained unfinished. The so-called Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber, 
						that contains a granite sarcophagus, are higher up, within the pyramid 
						structure. The funerary complex around the pyramid included two mortuary 
						temples connected by a causeway (one close to the pyramid and one near 
						the Nile), tombs for the immediate family and court of Khufu, including 
						three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller "satellite" 
						pyramid and five buried solar barges.
					</p>
					<p>
						Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon), is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid.
