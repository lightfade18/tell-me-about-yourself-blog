					&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pop” is a term derived from “Popular” and thus Pop 
					Music is known to be a genre of popular music. With its roots in the rock
					& roll style, this form can include any form of music ranging from urban 
					and dance to rock, country and Latin. Instruments highly used are electric
					guitars, synthesizer drums as well as bass and one can listen to this form 
					of music by listening to songs by Britney Spears, Madonna, Beyonce Lady 
					Gaga and of course the “King of Pop”, Michael Jackson.

				<p class="intro">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Acoustic music is music that solely or primarily uses instruments 
					that produce sound through acoustic means, as opposed to electric or electronic means.
					While all music was once acoustic, the retronym "acoustic music" appeared
					after the advent of electric instruments, such as the electric guitar, 
					electric violin, electric organ and synthesizer. Acoustic string 
					instrumentations had long been a subset of popular music, particularly 
					in folk. It stood in contrast to various other types of music in various 
					eras, including big band music in the pre-rock era, and electric music in
					the rock era.

				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"Photograph"</b> is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter
					Ed Sheeran for his second studio album, × (2014). Sheeran wrote the song 
					with Snow Patrol member Johnny McDaid, who had a piano loop from which 
					the composition developed. After recording several versions with other 
					producers, Sheeran eventually solicited help from Jeff Bhasker; the 
					collaboration generated a version that Bhasker further enhanced for 
					months. The ballad derives its music primarily from an acoustic guitar, 
					piano and programmed drums. With visually descriptive lyrics, it 
					discusses a long-distance relationship inspired by Sheeran's own 
					experience of being away from his then-girlfriend while he was on tour.
